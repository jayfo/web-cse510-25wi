# Course Overview

<UnderDevelopment display={false} />

## Course Description

This course provides an introduction to forms of contribution in several major areas of research in Human-Computer Interaction.
Course activities are based in a combination of readings, active discussion and reflection on readings, and a self-defined group project.
Across all of these, the course considers HCI research in terms of:

- **Contribution**: what knowledge is gained through research activities.
- **Method**: how research activities are structured to demonstrate contributions.
- **Framing**: why contributions are valued,
               through motivation, language, theory, or understanding that can contextualize contributions.

Course readings emphasize a combination of historic framing papers and more recent contributions.
Discussion and reflection emphasize consideration of readings in terms of their contributions,
methods applied in those contributions, and framings of those contributions.
The group project asks students to extend consideration of contributions, methods, and framings to their own activities.
The combination of course activities is therefore intended to
help students examine what the HCI research community considers a contribution across a variety of contexts,
thus helping prepare students to understand and make meaningful contributions in these and other areas of HCI research.

This course is explicitly not focused on iterative design methods or associated theory commonly emphasized in HCI practice.
We do not assume a strong background in HCI (i.e., there is no undergraduate HCI prerequisite),
but students seeking an introduction to effective design or an iterative design process will be better served by CSE 440.

## Learning Objectives

- Be able to differentiate forms of contribution in HCI research.
- Be able to describe prior fundamental results that frame areas of HCI research.
- Be able to articulate new contributions relative to such framings of areas of HCI research.
- Be able to consider, evaluate, and apply common HCI research methods.

## Course Coordination

- **Contact**

  Email course staff at &lt;cse510-staff [at] cs.washington.edu&gt;.

  Please do not email individual course staff.
  Using the course staff email list promotes both staff coordination and a more prompt response.
  Emails to individual course staff will typically have the staff email list added to any response.

  Although we may provide a Slack channel for lightweight communication,
  course staff cannot respond to individual inquiries via Slack.
  Slack messages to individual staff will be redirected to either the public channel or the staff email list.

- **Course Time & Location**

  Tuesdays & Thursdays, 10:00-11:20.

  [CSE2](https://www.washington.edu/maps/#!/cse2)
  Room [G10](https://www.washington.edu/classroom/CSE2+G10).

  The <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.calendarTop} /> will provide any non-standard times, locations, or staffing.

- **Office Hours**

  By appointment.

- **Canvas**

  <CourseDataLink linkKey={courseData.linkCanvas} outerComponent="p"/>

- **Drive**

Course information and material will provided primarily on this website.

Canvas and Drive will be used when appropriate for limiting access to course information and materials.

## Assignments

<AssignmentsOverview />

## Grading

Much of the grading in this course is necessarily subjective.
We will attempt to communicate expectations and feedback throughout the course,
but it is your responsibility to communicate with us if you would like additional guidance in this regard.

<UnderDevelopment display={true} />

<TBD outerComponent="div">
- XX%: Readings and Discussion Posts

- XX%: Student-Led Presentations and Discussions

- XX%: Project
  - X%: Proposal Preparation and Document
  - X%: Milestone 1 Report and Presentation
  - X%: Milestone 2 Report and Presentation
  - XX%: Final Report

- XX%: Reflection Reports

- XX%: Participation

{/*
The overall course grade will be computed as follows:

- 20%: Reading Reports and In-Class Small Group Discussion

  Reading reports will be graded 0 to 2 points as described in [Reading Reports](/assignments/readings#reading-reports).

- 45%: Project

  - 5%: Proposal Preparation and Document
  - 5%: Milestone 1 Report and Presentation
  - 5%: Milestone 2 Report and Presentation
  - 30%: Final Report

  Project proposal and milestone grading will emphasize progress and preparation to engage with direction and feedback.
  Strong grades will result from honest presentation of project status
  and useful scaffolding of a conversation that can support the project
  (e.g., realistic and concrete proposals, clear discussion of advice that a project currently needs).
  Proposals or milestones that are less than candid and thoughtful (e.g., vague, incomplete, oversold)
  all fail to take full advantage of an opportunity for feedback.

  Final project report grading will then emphasize overall project execution
  and appropriate presentation of project activities (e.g., clarity of activities, methods, and contributions).

- 10%: Statistics Lab, as described in [Statistics Lab](/assignments/statisticslab).
- 15%: Exam, as described in [Exam](/assignments/exam).
- 10%: Participation

  A participation grade corresponds to course goals for students to
  actively develop skills in discussing research activities and contributions
  (e.g., when discussing existing research, when discussing ongoing research).
  Participation will therefore include presence and participation in in-class discussions,
  participation in asynchronous and in-class project discussions, and other course activities.

  If you will be unable to participate in a course activity, email course staff beforehand.

</TBD>

Grades may also be adjusted based on participation and contribution in assignments.

### Late Policy

We generally expect all assignments will be submitted according to deadlines in the assignment description.
If there is a constraint or an emergency impacting your ability to submit an assignment,
contact the course staff before the assignment deadline by email to the course staff list.

We will do our best to be accommodating amidst requirements and expectations of the course
(e.g., expecting clear and early communication regarding any constraints,
understanding that assignments supporting in-class discussion serve little purpose after that discussion,
understanding that assignments support engagement and grading throughout the course).

### Regrade Policy

Any request for grade clarification or a re-grade must be submitted by email to the course staff list.
Requests will only be considered within 7 days of the release of a grade.

Because reflection grading is both subjective and anonymous, we will be highly averse to revisiting the grade of a reflection.
We will proactively work to promote fairness in the grading of these assignments,
and students should expect that we will decline a request to revisit the grade of a reflection
(e.g., because we cannot preserve anonymity in such a request).

Upon calculation of final grades, we will explicitly check for any particularly unfortunate effects of rounding
(e.g., adjusting a pre-rounding final grade of 3.649 to instead give a 3.7).
This is intended to provide peace of mind that final grades were not defined by any minor point deduction.

## Expectation of In-Person Participation

The course heavily emphasizes required in-person activities, including student-led presentations and discussions.
Full engagement with and contribution in group project activities also requires in-person participation.
In-person participation is therefore a required component of the course,
will be included in participation grading,
and can also impact grading of other course activities.
Remote participation will not be supported.

### COVID-19 Safety, Absences, Recordings, and Zoom

There may be reasons you cannot or should not participate in-person, including COVID-19 exposure or symptoms.
Our goal is for this course to provide an opportunity for learning without undermining safety,
and we all share responsibility for preserving safety of this learning environment.
Please review and adhere to COVID-19 related guidance, including:

<CourseDataLink linkKey={courseData.linkUniversityCovidGuidelines} outerComponent="p"/>

If you will be absent for any reason, contact the course staff before class by email to the course staff list.
We will track absence-related communication as part of the expectation of in-person participation,
and we will do our best to be accommodating amidst requirements and expectations of the course.

We will aim to record course sessions (e.g., unless a guest indicates they do not want to be recorded).
Recorded sessions will be available for review within
<CourseDataLink linkKey={courseData.linkCanvas}>Canvas</CourseDataLink>.
However, we expect recordings will be of relatively poor quality
and they are obviously an incomplete proxy for a discussion-focused course.
Nevertheless, recording may sometimes be the best available option.

We may also use Zoom as an accommodation (e.g., due to illness, due to requirements of a guest).
Zoom participation will use meeting information provided by email and in
<CourseDataLink linkKey={courseData.linkCanvas}>Canvas</CourseDataLink>.

## Accommodations and University Policies

Additional university policies apply
(e.g., regarding Academic Integrity, Conduct, Disability Resources, Face Coverings, Religious Accommodations):

<CourseDataLink linkKey={courseData.linkUniversitySyllabusGuidelines} outerComponent="p"/>

Please do not hesitate to contact the course staff regarding these or any other accommodations.
We are happy that you are here and want to support your engagement in this learning environment.

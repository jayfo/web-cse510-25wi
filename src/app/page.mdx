# Course Overview

<UnderDevelopment display={true} />

## Course Description

This course provides an introduction to forms of contribution in several major areas of research in Human-Computer Interaction.
Course activities are based in a combination of readings, active discussion and reflection on readings, and a self-defined group project.
Across all of these, the course considers HCI research in terms of:

- **Contribution**: what knowledge is gained through research activities.
- **Method**: how contributions are demonstrated.
- **Framing**: why contributions are valued.

Course readings emphasize a combination of historic framing papers and more recent contributions.
Discussion and reflection emphasize consideration of readings in terms of their contributions,
methods applied in those contributions, and framings of those contributions.
The group project asks students to extend consideration of contributions, methods, and framings to their own activities.
The combination of course activities is therefore intended to
help students examine what the HCI research community considers a contribution across a variety of contexts,
thus helping prepare students to understand and make meaningful contributions in these and other areas of HCI research.

This course is explicitly not focused on iterative design methods or associated theory commonly emphasized in HCI practice.
We do not assume a strong background in HCI (i.e., there is no undergraduate HCI prerequisite),
but students seeking an introduction to effective design or an iterative design process will be better served by CSE 440.

## Learning Objectives

- Be able to differentiate forms of contribution in HCI research.
- Be able to describe prior fundamental results that frame areas of HCI research.
- Be able to articulate new contributions relative to such framings of areas of HCI research.
- Be able to consider the relevance of, to evaluate, and to apply common HCI research methods.

## Grading

Much of the grading in this course is necessarily subjective.
We will attempt to communicate expectations and feedback throughout the course,
but it is your responsibility to communicate with us if you would like additional guidance in this regard.

<TBD outerComponent="div">
Overview of Grading TBD.

- XX%: Project

  - X%: Proposal Preparation and Document
  - X%: Milestone 1 Report and Presentation
  - X%: Milestone 2 Report and Presentation
  - XX%: Final Report

- XX%: Reading Reports and In-Class Small Group Discussion

- XX%: Student-Led Presentations

- XX%: Reflection Reports

- XX%: Participation

{/*
The overall course grade will be computed as follows:

- 20%: Reading Reports and In-Class Small Group Discussion

  Reading reports will be graded 0 to 2 points as described in [Reading Reports](/assignments/readings#reading-reports).

- 45%: Project

  - 5%: Proposal Preparation and Document
  - 5%: Milestone 1 Report and Presentation
  - 5%: Milestone 2 Report and Presentation
  - 30%: Final Report

  Project proposal and milestone grading will emphasize progress and preparation to engage with direction and feedback.
  Strong grades will result from honest presentation of project status
  and useful scaffolding of a conversation that can support the project
  (e.g., realistic and concrete proposals, clear discussion of advice that a project currently needs).
  Proposals or milestones that are less than candid and thoughtful (e.g., vague, incomplete, oversold)
  all fail to take full advantage of an opportunity for feedback.

  Final project report grading will then emphasize overall project execution
  and appropriate presentation of project activities (e.g., clarity of activities, methods, and contributions).

- 10%: Statistics Lab, as described in [Statistics Lab](/assignments/statisticslab).
- 15%: Exam, as described in [Exam](/assignments/exam).
- 10%: Participation

  A participation grade corresponds to course goals for students to
  actively develop skills in discussing research activities and contributions
  (e.g., when discussing existing research, when discussing ongoing research).
  Participation will therefore include presence and participation in in-class discussions,
  participation in asynchronous and in-class project discussions, and other course activities.

  If you will be unable to participate in a course activity, email course staff beforehand.

</TBD>

Grades may also be adjusted based on participation and contribution in assignments.

### Late Policy

We generally expect all assignments will be submitted according to deadlines in the assignment description.
If there is a constraint or an emergency impacting your ability to submit an assignment,
contact the course staff before the assignment deadline by email to the course staff list.

We will do our best to be accommodating amidst requirements and expectations of the course
(e.g., expecting clear and early communication regarding any constraints,
understanding that assignments supporting in-class discussion serve little purpose after that discussion,
understanding that assignments support engagement and grading throughout the course).

### Regrade Policy

Any request for grade clarification or a re-grade must be submitted by email to the course staff list.
Requests will only be considered within 7 days of the release of a grade.

Upon calculation of final grades, we will explicitly check for any particularly unfortunate effects of rounding
(e.g., adjusting a pre-rounding final grade of 3.649 to instead give a 3.7).
This is intended to provide peace of mind that final grades were not defined by any minor point deduction.

## Expectation of In-Person Participation

The course heavily emphasizes required in-person activities, including student-led presentations and discussions.
Full engagement with and contribution in group project activities also requires in-person participation.
In-person participation is therefore a required component of the course,
will be included in participation grading,
and can also impact grading of other course activities.
Remote participation will not be supported.

### COVID-19 Safety, Absences, Recordings, and Zoom

There may be reasons you cannot or should not participate in-person, including COVID-19 exposure or symptoms.
Our goal is for this course to provide an opportunity for learning without undermining safety,
and we all share responsibility for preserving safety of this learning environment.
Please review and adhere to COVID-19 related guidance, including:

<CourseDataLink linkKey={courseData.linkUniversityCovidGuidelines} outerComponent="p"/>

If you will be absent for any reason, contact the course staff before class by email to the course staff list.
We will track absence-related communication as part of the expectation of in-person participation,
and we will do our best to be accommodating amidst requirements and expectations of the course.

We will aim to record course sessions (e.g., unless a guest indicates they do not want to be recorded).
Recorded sessions will be available for review within
<CourseDataLink linkKey={courseData.linkCanvas}>Canvas</CourseDataLink>.
However, we expect recordings will be of relatively poor quality
and they are obviously an incomplete proxy for a discussion-focused course.
Nevertheless, recording may sometimes be the best available option.

We may also use Zoom as an accommodation (e.g., due to illness, due to requirements of a guest).
Zoom participation will use meeting information provided by email and in
<CourseDataLink linkKey={courseData.linkCanvas}>Canvas</CourseDataLink>.

## Accommodations and University Policies

Additional university policies apply
(e.g., regarding Academic Integrity, Conduct, Disability Resources, Face Coverings, Religious Accommodations):

<CourseDataLink linkKey={courseData.linkUniversitySyllabusGuidelines} outerComponent="p"/>

Please do not hesitate to contact the course staff regarding these or any other accommodations.
We are happy that you are here and want to support your engagement in this learning environment.

## Contributing

This course website lives on GitHub:

<CourseDataLink linkKey={courseData.linkGitHub} outerComponent="p"/>


{/*

The course project will require hands-on experience with HCI, while remaining open to different possibilities.
You might choose to design and implement a new piece of HCI technology,
or you might choose to design and execute an appropriately compelling study with HCI research implications.

We will emphasize learning through discussion and feedback in all aspects of the course.

## Grading

Strive to do good work because you care about your own opportunities to learn,
including the opportunities this course provides working with a group in an intensive project.

### Project Milestones, Assignments, and Reports

The project is composed of five milestones.
Each milestone includes contributing assignments and culminates in a milestone report or other final deliverables.

#### Assignments
Contributing assignments will be graded for completion of key components listed in the assignment.
Because the course is designed around feedback and improvement,
assignment grades indicate you have invested sufficient effort and insight at the time of the submission.

Completion grading will generally be on a 2 point scale, and can roughly be interpreted as:

- 2: Meets completion expectations.
- 1: Somewhat problematic or incomplete relative to expectations.
- 0: Missing or severely problematic or incomplete relative to expectations.

Quality ratings will then generally provide lightweight feedback on each assignment's key components.
Quality ratings do not directly impact grading of assignments or milestone reports,
but suggest where staff feel you should invest effort to revise your materials
as you continue in your design and assemble your materials for the milestone report.

Assignment quality ratings are on a scale from ⭐ to ⭐⭐⭐⭐ and can roughly be interpreted as follows:

- ⭐⭐⭐⭐: High Quality

  Such work is very strong. This is above what is inherently expected and will not be a common rating,
  but allows course staff to indicate appreciation of very strong work.

- ⭐⭐⭐: Meets Expectations

  Such work is good, but may still leave room for improvement.

- ⭐⭐: Could Improve

  Such work is on the right track, but could benefit from substantial development and revision.

- ⭐: Insufficient

  Such work does not accomplish the intended goal and will need much more work.
  If you do not already know why an assignment receives this rating, we encourage you to reach out to the course staff.

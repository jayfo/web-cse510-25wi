# Course Overview

<UnderDevelopment display={true} />

## Course Description

This course provides an introduction to forms of contribution in several major areas of research in Human-Computer Interaction.
Course activities are based in a combination of readings, active discussion and reflection on readings, and a self-defined group project.
Course readings emphasize a combination of historic framing papers and more recent contributions.
Discussion and reflection emphasize consideration of readings in terms of their specific contributions,
methods applied in those contributions, and larger framings of those contributions.
The group project asks students to extend consideration of specific contributions, methods, and framings to their own research activities.
The combination of course activities is therefore intended to
help students examine what the HCI research community considers a contribution across a variety of contexts,
thus helping prepare students to understand and make meaningful contributions in these and other areas of HCI research.

This course is explicitly not focused on iterative design methods or associated theory commonly emphasized in HCI practice.
We do not assume a strong background in HCI (i.e., there is no undergraduate HCI prerequisite),
but students seeking an introduction to effective design or an iterative design process will be better served by CSE 440.

{/*

The course project will require hands-on experience with HCI, while remaining open to different possibilities.
You might choose to design and implement a new piece of HCI technology,
or you might choose to design and execute an appropriately compelling study with HCI research implications.

We will emphasize learning through discussion and feedback in all aspects of the course.

## Learning Objectives

- Be able to differentiate forms of contribution in HCI research.
- Be able to describe prior fundamental results that now frame areas of HCI research.
- Be able to articulate new contributions in such areas of HCI research.
- Be able to apply and evaluate relevance of common HCI research methods.
- Be able to contribute advice and perspective across multiple HCI research projects.

## Assignments

<AssignmentsOverview />

## Grading

Much of the grading in this course is necessarily subjective.
We will attempt to communicate expectations and feedback throughout the course,
but it is your responsibility to communicate with us if you would like additional guidance in this regard.

The overall course grade will be computed as follows:

- 20%: Reading Reports and In-Class Small Group Discussion

  Reading reports will be graded 0 to 2 points as described in [Reading Reports](/assignments/readings#reading-reports).

- 45%: Project

  - 5%: Proposal Preparation and Document
  - 5%: Milestone 1 Report and Presentation
  - 5%: Milestone 2 Report and Presentation
  - 30%: Final Report

  Project proposal and milestone grading will emphasize progress and preparation to engage with direction and feedback.
  Strong grades will result from honest presentation of project status
  and useful scaffolding of a conversation that can support the project
  (e.g., realistic and concrete proposals, clear discussion of advice that a project currently needs).
  Proposals or milestones that are less than candid and thoughtful (e.g., vague, incomplete, oversold)
  all fail to take full advantage of an opportunity for feedback.

  Final project report grading will then emphasize overall project execution
  and appropriate presentation of project activities (e.g., clarity of activities, methods, and contributions).

- 10%: Statistics Lab, as described in [Statistics Lab](/assignments/statisticslab).
- 15%: Exam, as described in [Exam](/assignments/exam).
- 10%: Participation

  A participation grade corresponds to course goals for students to
  actively develop skills in discussing research activities and contributions
  (e.g., when discussing existing research, when discussing ongoing research).
  Participation will therefore include presence and participation in in-class discussions,
  participation in asynchronous and in-class project discussions, and other course activities.

  If you will be unable to participate in a course activity, email course staff beforehand.

## Wellness and Safety

Our goal is for this course to provide an opportunity for learning without undermining wellness or safety.

Consistent with university guidance and policies, this is an in-person course.
Class may be conducted via Zoom when indicated in the <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.calendarTop} />
(e.g., due to requirements of a guest, due to instructor illness).

This course heavily emphasizes discussion and participation.
In-person attendance is generally expected and is part of participation grading,
but there may be reasons you cannot or should not attend in-person (e.g., COVID symptoms, COVID exposure).
In these circumstances, contact the course staff.
Prior to class, we will accept email indicating that a student cannot attend for reasons of wellness or safety.
We will work to ensure this does not negatively impact students (e.g., in their participation grade).
If you are unsure whether you should attend, please reach out and know that we will do our best to be accommodating.
Our goal is to encourage and support you in decisions that preserve safety.

We will aim to record course sessions (e.g., unless a guest indicates they do not want to be recorded).
Recorded sessions will be made available for asynchronous review within
<CourseStoreLink linkKey="linkCanvas">Canvas</CourseStoreLink>.
However, we expect recordings will be of relatively poor quality
and they are obviously an incomplete proxy for a discussion-focused course.
Nevertheless, recording may sometimes be the best available option relative to our wellness and safety goals.

We also welcome any additional feedback in how we can best structure this course while ensuring this goal.

## Course Description

This course provides an introduction to human-computer interaction and the design process.
Students will learn methods and skills for designing and prototyping interactive systems.
The course covers a design process from the initial formulation of a design problem to creation of digital prototypes.
Importantly, the course does not emphasize development but instead fully focuses on design.

The course structure is a mix of lectures, hands-on activities, and design critiques by peers and course staff.
The course is overwhelmingly organized around a group project, in which students:

- Ideate and Propose Design Problems
- Study Existing Practices and Challenges
- Explore Potential Design Opportunities and Tradeoffs
- Evaluate and Iterate Upon a Design
- Communicate a Problem and Resulting Design

## Learning Objectives

- Process-Focused Perspective on Interaction Design

## Assignments

<AssignmentsOverview />

## Grading

Strive to do good work because you care about your own opportunities to learn,
including the opportunities this course provides working with a group in an intensive project.

Design is an inherently subjective practice, and so grading in this course is necessarily subjective.
The stated project requirements are often the minimum,
intended to leave room for groups to earn strong grades through strong work.

### Project Milestones, Assignments, and Reports

The project is composed of five milestones.
Each milestone includes contributing assignments and culminates in a milestone report or other final deliverables.

#### Assignments
Contributing assignments will be graded for completion of key components listed in the assignment.
Because the course is designed around feedback and improvement,
assignment grades indicate you have invested sufficient effort and insight at the time of the submission.

Completion grading will generally be on a 2 point scale, and can roughly be interpreted as:

- 2: Meets completion expectations.
- 1: Somewhat problematic or incomplete relative to expectations.
- 0: Missing or severely problematic or incomplete relative to expectations.

Quality ratings will then generally provide lightweight feedback on each assignment's key components.
Quality ratings do not directly impact grading of assignments or milestone reports,
but suggest where staff feel you should invest effort to revise your materials
as you continue in your design and assemble your materials for the milestone report.

Assignment quality ratings are on a scale from ⭐ to ⭐⭐⭐⭐ and can roughly be interpreted as follows:

- ⭐⭐⭐⭐: High Quality

  Such work is very strong. This is above what is inherently expected and will not be a common rating,
  but allows course staff to indicate appreciation of very strong work.

- ⭐⭐⭐: Meets Expectations

  Such work is good, but may still leave room for improvement.

- ⭐⭐: Could Improve

  Such work is on the right track, but could benefit from substantial development and revision.

- ⭐: Insufficient

  Such work does not accomplish the intended goal and will need much more work.
  If you do not already know why an assignment receives this rating, we encourage you to reach out to the course staff.

#### Milestone Reports and Final Deliverables
The bulk of project grading is then associated with milestone reports and final deliverables,
which are evaluated more directly on their quality.
Each milestone report will be predominantly composed of material you prepared in that milestone's assignments,
with additional expectation of revision and refinement of previously-submitted content
together with reflection on your design process.

Each milestone report will provide a point breakdown conveying how it will be graded.

### Overall Course Grade

### Late Policy

We generally expect all assignments will be submitted according to the deadline in Canvas and the assignment description.
This is a fast-paced course, with many elements of the project depending on prior elements.
The course staff's ability to give feedback also relies on timely submissions
(e.g., course staff will often review submissions soon after they are submitted to be ready for course activities).

If your group feels that you would really benefit from an extension,
or if there is an emergency impacting your ability to submit an assignment,
contact the course staff before the submission deadline.

We will do our best to be flexible and work with you so that your group stays on track.
Extensions of a few hours can often be facilitated.
Except in extreme circumstances, we will typically not be able to give an extension of more than 1 day.

### Regrade Policy

Any request for grade clarification or a re-grade must be submitted via the course staff email list.
Requests will only be considered within 7 days of the release of a grade.

Upon calculation of final grades, we will explicitly check for any particularly unfortunate effects of rounding
(e.g., adjusting a pre-rounding final grade of 3.649 to instead give a 3.7).
This is intended to provide peace of mind that final grades were not defined by any minor point deduction.

## Participation and COVID-19 Safety

Our goal is for this course to provide an opportunity for learning without undermining wellness or safety.
Active participation in activities is central to this course,
and we all share responsibility for preserving safety of this learning environment.
Please review and adhere to related policies, including
[UW COVID-19 Illness and Exposure Guidance](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/covid-19-prevention-and-response/covid-19-illness-and-exposure-guidance).

### Expectation of In-Person Participation

The course heavily emphasizes a group project and participation in associated in-class activities.
In-person participation is expected for both lecture and section,
is part of participation grading,
and can also impact grading of your contribution to the group project.

### Remote Participation and Recordings

There may be reasons you cannot or should not attend in-person
(e.g., COVID exposure, COVID symptoms).
In these circumstances, contact the course staff for permission to attend remotely.
If you are unsure whether you should attend,
please reach out and know that we will do our best to be accommodating.
Our goal is to encourage and support you in decisions that preserve everybody's safety.

Students with permission may attend via the Zoom link provided in <CourseStoreLink linkKey="linkCanvas">Canvas</CourseStoreLink>.
A member of the course staff will also aim to monitor the Zoom chat for questions.
If class splits into project group activities,
the Zoom meeting will end and remote students should join their group
via a video call with a member of their group.

We will also use the in-room Panopto system to record lecture components of the course.
This can support review of material, but is not a substitute for in-person activities.

## Accommodations and University Policies

Additional university policies apply
(e.g., regarding Academic Integrity, Conduct, Disability Resources, Face Coverings, Religious Accommodations):

<CourseStoreLink outerComponent="p" linkKey='linkUniversitySyllabusGuidelines' />

Please do not hesitate to contact the course staff regarding these or any other accommodations.
We are happy that you are here and want to support your engagement in this learning environment.

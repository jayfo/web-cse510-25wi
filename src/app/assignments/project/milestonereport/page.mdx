# Project Milestone Report

This is a component of the <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.assignmentsProjectTop}/> assignment.
Be sure you have reviewed that larger context.

Two milestone reports serve as a check on the trajectory of your project
and an opportunity for feedback, guidance, and questions.
Convey the state of your project and your plans for the remainder of the quarter.

Milestone reports consist of a short document and an associated meeting with course staff.

You will also be asked to review milestone reports submitted by other groups
and to share potential insight related to questions they have or advice they seek.

## Document

Within the provided document, using the provided template, prepare a report addressing the following points:

- **Current Progress**

  What you have done for this milestone, discussing current progress relative to previously stated plans.

- **Planned Activities**

  What you will do before your next milestone, including any revisions to your plans based on your status or findings.

- **Desired Feedback**

  Any areas where you have questions, could use advice, or would like ideas.

This is an opportunity for feedback from staff and classmates.
Our primary goal is feedback that helps you in the remaining aspects of the project.
Please be appropriately candid, thoughtful, and engaged.
You will gain maximum value from this report by
considering how it can structure a conversation that is most useful to your project group.

## Format

Report should be 2 pages, using the same format as the provided template (i.e., an 11-point Arial format).

The page limit does not apply to figures or images.
To ensure the text of your report remains within the page limit,
place all figures or images after the 2 pages of report text (e.g., referencing them from text as "Figure 1").

The page limit does not apply to references, which may be an additional page.

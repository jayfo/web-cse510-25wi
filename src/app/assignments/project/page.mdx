# Project

A group project is a major component of the course.
This will require hands-on experience with HCI research, while remaining open to different possibilities.

Because we assume you are new to HCI research, we do not necessarily expect you to produce publishable work.
Instead, the expectation is that you will do something interesting while engaging with contribution, method, and framing.
It is largely up to you to define what you want to accomplish in this project,
while seeking appropriate feedback from staff. For example, you might choose to:

- Design and implement a new piece of HCI technology.
- Design and execute a study with HCI research implications.
- Perform a feasibility analysis or pilot study to inform future research plans.
- Replicate an existing study or technology to gain experience or enable future research.
- Execute a design or development effort in the context of an established research project.

Due to the size of this course and constraints on course time and resources, we expect projects will be conducted in groups of three or four.
Working in groups is a necessary part of doing research, and it is also important for the logistics of this course.

## Project Deliverables

Project deliverables are defined in terms of a proposal, a pair of self-defined milestone reports, and a final report.

# Project

A group project is a major component of the course.
This will require hands-on experience with HCI research, while remaining open to different possibilities.

Because we assume you are new to HCI research, we do not necessarily expect you to produce publishable work.
Instead, the expectation is that you will do something interesting while engaging with contribution, method, and framing.
It is largely up to you to define what you want to accomplish in this project,
while seeking appropriate feedback from staff. For example, you might choose to:

- Design and implement a new piece of HCI technology.
- Design and execute a study with HCI research implications.
- Perform a feasibility analysis or pilot study to inform future research plans.
- Replicate an existing study or technology to gain experience or enable future research.
- Execute a design or development effort in the context of an established research project.

Due to the size of this course and constraints on course time and resources, we expect projects will be conducted in groups of three or four.
Working in groups is a necessary part of doing research, and it is also important for the logistics of this course.

## Project Deliverables

Project deliverables are defined in terms of a proposal, a pair of self-defined milestone reports, and a final report.

**Proposal Due**: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.projectProposal} />.

**Milestone Report 1 Due**: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.projectMilestoneReport1} />.

**Milestone Report 2 Due**: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.projectMilestoneReport2} />.

**Final Report Due**: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.projectFinalReport} />.

## Proposal

Your proposal will define your initial plan for this project.
You can and should update this plan based on feedback, progress, and findings.
The proposal therefore needs to demonstrate a robust initial plan for your project,
but your project is expected to evolve as appropriate and necessary.

You are welcome and even encouraged to align your project with research goals outside this course.
However, it is critical to define what you will specifically accomplish in the course project.
The course project must stand on its own, even if drawn from a larger research context.

Proposals consist of a short document, prepared with feedback prior to the due date.

### Proposal Document

Within the provided document, using the provided template, prepare a proposal addressing the following points:

- **Abstract**:

  Summarize the proposal using up to 150 words.

- **Problem Statement**:

  What makes the project interesting? What is the problem or research question?

  What is the challenge you want to address, the capability you want to enable, or the question you want to explore?

- **Background and Related Work**:

  What existing understanding of the problem have you developed?

  For a proposal focused on a study, this could cover the most important related work that sets a context for the question you want to explore.

  For a proposal focused on development, this could introduce what you intend to develop and why this requires or could enable research.

  For a proposal focused on design, this could introduce a need, existing solutions, why they fall short, an insight that suggests a potential opportunity.

  For a proposal based within a larger project outside the context of this course, this will also provide key context regarding that outside project.

- **Proposed Milestones**:

  What milestones will the group plan to accomplish?

  There are two milestone reports in the quarter. These are opportunities for feedback and guidance. Explain what your group will plan to accomplish by each of these milestones. You will be asked to revisit these plans during those milestone reports.

- **Scope, Limitations, and Contingencies**:

  What might the group explicitly decide to omit, and how will you ensure a successful project?

  Progress requires focus, as you cannot accomplish everything.
  Explain what aspects of the project you might choose to defer in this course project.
  This is your opportunity to scope the project appropriately for this course.

  Identify potential major barriers to accomplishing your proposed work in the timeline of the course
  and your plans for a successful project if those potential barriers undermine your current plans.
  Proposals are effectively a contract on what you aim to accomplish, but they are also an opportunity for feedback.
  Be appropriately candid and thoughtful so as to receive maximum benefit from feedback.

### Proposal Format

Proposals should be 2 pages, using the same format as the provided template (i.e., an 11-point Arial format).

The page limit does not apply to figures or images.
To ensure the text of your proposal remains within the page limit,
place all figures or images after the 2 pages of proposal text (e.g., referencing them from text as "Figure 1").

The page limit does not apply to references, which may be an additional page.

### Proposal Preparation and Early Feedback

Prepare your proposal in this shared document:

<CourseDataLink outerComponent="p" linkKey={courseData.linkDriveProposalDocument} />

The use of a shared document for proposal preparation is intended to support early feedback.
Feel free to use comments to tag staff and classmates with questions.
We will also encourage you to review and comment on each other's proposals.

We have also dedicated time for in-class proposal preparation and review.
Proposals that are already beginning to develop will receive maximum benefit from feedback in this time.

### Project Ideas

Some sample project ideas, gathered from faculty and researchers, will be made available here:

<CourseDataLink outerComponent="p" linkKey={courseData.linkCanvasDiscussionProjectIdeas} />

### Proposal Samples

Sample project proposals from prior offerings have been made available here:

<CourseDataLink outerComponent="p" linkKey={courseData.linkCanvasProjectProposalSamples} />

Note that prior proposals were based on different format guidance
(e.g., sometimes lacked an expected structure, sometimes had a different page count, sometimes were paired with in-class presentations).
Be sure to engage with the guidance on desired proposal format in this offering.

### Proposal Submission

Due: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.projectProposal} />.

Submit your proposal document in PDF format:

<AssignmentSubmitCanvasLink outerComponent="p" assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.projectProposal} />

## Milestone Reports

Two milestone reports serve as a check on the trajectory of your project
and an opportunity for feedback, guidance, and questions.
Convey the state of your project and your plans for the remainder of the quarter.

Milestone reports consist of a short document and an associated meeting with course staff.

You will also be asked to review milestone reports submitted by other groups
and to share potential insight related to questions they have or advice they seek.

### Milestone Report

Within the provided document, using the provided template, prepare a report addressing the following points:

- **Current Progress**

  What you have done for this milestone, discussing current progress relative to previously stated plans.

- **Planned Activities**

  What you will do before your next milestone, including any revisions to your plans based on your status or findings.

- **Desired Feedback**

  Any areas where you have questions, could use advice, or would like ideas.

This is an opportunity for feedback from staff and classmates.
Our primary goal is feedback that helps you in the remaining aspects of the project.
Please be appropriately candid, thoughtful, and engaged.
You will gain maximum value from this report by
considering how it can structure a conversation that is most useful to your project group.

### Milestone Report Format

Report should be 2 pages, using the same format as the provided template (i.e., an 11-point Arial format).

The page limit does not apply to figures or images.
To ensure the text of your report remains within the page limit,
place all figures or images after the 2 pages of report text (e.g., referencing them from text as "Figure 1").

The page limit does not apply to references, which may be an additional page.

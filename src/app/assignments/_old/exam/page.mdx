# Exam

An at-home open-book exam will give an opportunity to demonstrate and apply your understanding of course material in a more substantial format.
It requires you to connect concepts across course readings, serving as an evaluation of your understanding and critical thinking about course concepts.
If you have kept pace with the readings, you will find this exam much easier to approach
(e.g., simply referring back to readings, rather than needing to understand them from scratch).
You may reference any of the articles, slides, notes, discussion posts, or other material readily available on the web.
You may consult the course staff with any questions, but this is strictly an individual assignment (i.e., do not discuss it with others).

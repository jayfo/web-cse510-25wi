import { FormattedReading } from '@/components/FormattedReading';

Read the framing paper:

<ul>
    <li key={props.readings.framing.title}>
        <p><FormattedReading reading={props.readings.framing}/></p>
    </li>
</ul>

### Reading Format

No reading report is assigned.

Each student has three responsibilities:

- Read the framing paper and come prepared for discussion.

  Although class will not use the full discussion format,
  it will include time dedicated to small-group discussion and the surfacing of questions from those discussions.

- Select any two full papers from a recent major HCI research conference.
  Find papers by searching the web or by browsing and searching conference programs.

  For example, [CHI 2024](https://chi2024.acm.org/) provides a searchable program:

  [CHI 2024 Program](https://programs.sigchi.org/chi/2024/program/all?CONTENT_TYPE%5B%5D=13341;13269&itemsType=CONTENT&sortDirection=asc&sortType=TITLE&viewType=LIST)

  Ensure papers you select are full papers
  (i.e., marked as part of the "Papers" track in blue or the "Journals" track in green,
  noting the link above is configured to filter content from other CHI 2024 tracks).

  You may select any papers you want to spend more time reviewing
  (e.g., papers that seem interesting for any reason,
  papers related to a topic that might help inform your identification of a course project,
  papers related to a form of contribution or a method that might help inform your proposal of a course project).
  Given this day's focus on forms of contribution,
  you may want to choose two papers that emphasize different forms of contribution.

  Review your selected papers with a focus on how they organize their research and present their contributions,
  within the forms of contribution presented by the framing paper.
  We do not expect you to focus on the details of these papers, but rather their organization and how their research is presented.
  You can and should skim according to your needs.
  In-class discussion will focus on the framing paper.

- Submit this Form, sharing your selected papers and their primary form of contribution:

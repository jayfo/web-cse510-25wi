These "vision" papers challenged a dominant pattern,
proposed going beyond mimicking prior technologies, or cast a vision of future technologies.
This is not an exhaustive set of such papers, just a set chosen to be interesting and appropriate.

        <li key={readingCurrent.title}>

### Reading Format

No reading report is assigned.

Each student has two responsibilities:

- Organize into groups to briefly present one of the above vision papers.

  Remember most people will not have read the paper you are presenting.
  It is therefore your responsibility to explain the vision.
  One useful way of breaking down and explaining the vision might be to discuss these points:

  - What was the status quo at the time the authors wrote this?
  - What was the author’s vision of future technologies?
  - How has this vision played out since this publication?

  Available time for each paper is extremely limited.
  You will not be able to fully present these papers,
  but aim to give your classmates insight into what they might find if they were to read the paper.
  Rehearse your presentation to ensure you stay within the agreed time.

  Sign up for a paper, and collaborate as a group to
  prepare your presentation as 2 to 3 slides in the shared Slides deck for this day:

  <CourseDataLink outerComponent="p" linkKey={courseData.linkDrive} />

- Individually review at least one more of the above vision papers.

  Reading a second paper benefits in-class discussion, helping you see these visions and explore them appropriately.
  Because some of these papers are quite long, you can and should skim according to your needs.

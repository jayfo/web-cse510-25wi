# Site uses paths like /assignments/readings#reading-reports.
# Static export generates files like /assignments/readings.html.
# Directly accessing an export therefore fails because /assignments/readings/index.html does not exist.
# Setting nextConfig's trailingSlash to true resolved this,
# but as of 2023-09-01 it is also causing loss of a trailing hash (e.g., #reading-reports).
#
# Manually maintaining this set of redirects will be sufficient for a small site.
